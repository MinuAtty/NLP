# Natural Language Processing (NLP) üß†üìù

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP is a critical component in many modern AI applications, including chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

## Common NLP Techniques
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or subwords.
- **Stop Word Removal**: Filtering out common words (like "the", "is", "and") that don‚Äôt add much meaning.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run").
- **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical representations. Popular methods:
  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Counting word frequencies.
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weighing word importance based on frequency.
  - **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**: Representing words in dense vector spaces.
  - **Contextual Embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT)**: Embeddings generated based on the context of a word in a sentence.

## Popular NLP Libraries & Tools
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A comprehensive library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, POS tagging, and stemming.
- **spaCy**: A fast and efficient NLP library with pre-trained models for tasks like named entity recognition, POS tagging, and dependency parsing.
- **Transformers (by Hugging Face)**: A library for working with state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) for various NLP tasks.
- **Gensim**: Focuses on unsupervised learning and topic modeling, like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and word embeddings.
- **TextBlob**: Simple NLP library for text classification, sentiment analysis, and translation.
